### Predicting House Sales Prices Using Advanced Regression Techniques

This project was based on a Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

The goal for this project is to practice on feature engineering, data EDA,  using machine learning regression techniques to select best prediction model for home sales prices. The dataset I used consisted of 79 variables describing features of homes in Ames, Iowa.

I used Numpy, Pandas, and Seaborn plots for exploratory data analysis and data cleaning.

From the scikit-learn library I built a series of grid-searched k-neighbors, tree-based models to try to improve my predictive accuracy.
